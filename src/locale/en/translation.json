  "aboutText": "Japanese Imperial House (Japanese: 皇室; kōshitsu), also known as the Imperial Family and the Yamato dynasty, or Sumera-gi, is a general term used to refer to the Japanese royal dynasty - the Emperor and members of the imperial family. According to the current Constitution of Japan, the Emperor is the \"symbol of the state and of the unity of the people.\" Other members of the imperial family perform ceremonial and public duties but do not have any role in state affairs. The duties of the Emperor are inherited by their male children.\n\nThe Japanese monarchy is considered the oldest continuous hereditary monarchy in the world. The Imperial House recognizes 126 monarchs, starting with the legendary Emperor Jimmu (traditionally dated to February 11, 660 BC) and continuing to the current Emperor Naruhito.\n\nHistorical evidence of the first 29 emperors is based on legends, but there is solid evidence of the hereditary line since Emperor Kinmei ascended the throne 1500 years ago",
